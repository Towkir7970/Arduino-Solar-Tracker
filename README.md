# Arduino-Solar-Tracker
This is a single axis arduino solar tracker system. In this project, I used a servo motor to move the solar panel to the preferred position. Intensity of light is detected using LDR. This system has a humidity, temperature and fire tracker. Humidity and Temperature is measured using DHT11 sensor. These are always shown in the LCD display attached to the arduino. Flame sensor is used to detect fire. If the temperature or humidity is not sufficient, the system will turn off automatically. Also, during fire, the system will turn off. a buzzer will start to make alarm sound constantly and a LED will turn on until the fire is put off.
